# pymaceuticals-challenge

This week challenge I finished with  https://pandas.pydata.org, chat GPT, and some extra on line resoures.
When i was doing the part of the quartiles, I did not take the correct aproach, but I coldn't have a loop that worked, so I try that code. The code it's kind of repetitive, but it gave mne a good idea on how to get the percentiles and iqr.
